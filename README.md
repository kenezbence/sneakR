        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    b.  This command reads the `package.json` file and downloads all the necessary libraries and dependencies for the Angular frontend. Wait for it to complete.
```
#### Phase 7: Project Setup (Backend - Java/WildFly)
```
1.  **Open Backend Project in NetBeans:**
    a.  Launch NetBeans IDE.
    b.  Go to `File` > `Open Project...`.
    c.  Navigate to the directory within your `sneakR` repository that contains your Java backend project (e.g., `sneakR/backend-java-app` or similar).

    e.  Click "Open Project".
2.  **Build the Backend Project:**
    d.  **If standard NetBeans project:**
        i.  Right-click on the project.
        ii. Select `Build` or `Clean and Build`.
    e.  **Expected Outcome:** This step should compile your Java code and package it into a `.war` (Web Application ARchive) file. Note the name and location of this `.war` file (e.g., `target/sneakR-backend.war` or `build/libs/sneakR-backend.war`).
3.  **Deploy the `.war` file to WildFly:**

    e.  Click "Create".
4.  **Create Database Tables and Populate Initial Data (if any):**
    b.  **Option 1: Using SQL script files:**
        i.In phpMyAdmin, select your newly created database (e.g., `sneakr`) from the left panel.
        ii. Click on the "Import" tab.
        iii.  Under "File to import", click "Browse..." and locate your `sneakr.sql` file. Click "Open".
        iv. Ensure the character set is correct (e.g., UTF-8).
        v.Click "Go" (or "Import") at the bottom of the page.
```
#### Phase 9: Environment Variables & Configuration
```
* **Backend (Java/WildFly) Configuration:**
```    1.  **Database Connection:**
        b.  **If WildFly Datasource (Recommended for Java EE):**
            i.  You need to configure a datasource in WildFly's `standalone/configuration/standalone.xml` (or the profile you use, e.g., `standalone-full.xml`).

                    <connection-url>jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sneakr?useSSL=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC</connection-url>
                    <driver>mysql</driver> <security>
                        <user-name>root</user-name> <password>root</password> </security>
                </datasource>
                <drivers>
                    <driver name="mysql" module="com.mysql">
                        <driver-class>com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver</driver-class>
                    </driver>

                <properties>
                    <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.url" value="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/sneakr_db?useSSL=false&amp;serverTimezone=UTC"/>
                    <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.user" value="root"/> <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.password" value="root"/> <property name="javax.persistence.jdbc.driver" value="com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver"/>
                    <property name="hibernate.dialect" value="org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect"/>
                    <property name="hibernate.hbm2ddl.auto" value="update"/> </properties>
                ```
```
### Launching the Application (Putting It All Together)
```
1.  **Step 1: Start MAMP Servers (if not already running):**
    a.  Open the MAMP control panel.
    b.  Ensure "Apache Server" and "MySQL Server" have green status indicators. Click their "Start" buttons if they are stopped.
2.  **Step 2: Start WildFly Application Server (if not already running):**
    a.  **Option A: From NetBeans IDE:**
        i.  Open NetBeans.
        ii. Go to the "Services" tab.
        iii.Right-click on your configured WildFly server (e.g., "WildFly Application Server").
        iv. Select "Start".
        v.  Monitor the "Output" window in NetBeans for WildFly's startup logs and for your backend application's deployment status.
    b.  **Option B: From Command Line:**
        i.  Open a new Terminal/Command Prompt.
        ii. Navigate to WildFly's `bin` directory: `cd <WILDFLY_HOME>/bin`
        iii.Run:
            * Windows: `standalone.bat`
            * macOS/Linux: `sh standalone.sh`
        iv. Monitor the console output for startup and deployment messages. Look for lines indicating your `.war` file has been deployed.
    c.  **Verification:** Once WildFly is running and your app is deployed, you should be able to access the WildFly Management Console at `http://localhost:9990` (log in with the user from Phase 3.5). Your backend application might also have a root context or health check endpoint you can test. [*Specify if there's a backend health check URL, e.g., `http://localhost:8080/sneakR-backend/health`*]
3.  **Step 3: Run the Angular Frontend Application:**
    a.  Open Visual Studio Code.
    b.  Ensure your `sneakR` project folder is open.
    c.  Open the integrated terminal (`View` > `Terminal` or `Ctrl+`` `).
    d.  Navigate into your Angular project's directory in the terminal (e.g., `cd frontend` - [*Adjust path if needed*]).
    e.  Execute the Angular development server command:
        ```bash
        ng serve -o
        ```
        * `ng serve` compiles the Angular application and starts a local development server.
        * The `-o` flag automatically opens the application in your default web browser.
4.  **Step 4: Access and Use the Application:**
    a.  **Frontend:** Your web browser should have opened to `http://localhost:4200` (this is the default port for Angular CLI's `ng serve`). If not, manually navigate to this URL.
    b.  **Backend API Interaction:** The frontend will make requests to the backend API URL configured in `environment.ts`.
    c.  You should now be able to register, log in, and use the SneakR application features.
